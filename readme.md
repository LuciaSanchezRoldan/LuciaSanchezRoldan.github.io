Hi Lucia!

To get started, open your terminal on mac.
in the terminal use
    $ cd DropBox
    $ cd LuciaSanchezRoldan.github.io
to navigate into the website folder. If you ever delete it, you can 'clone' it again anytime using
    $ git clone https://github.com/LuciaSanchezRoldan/LuciaSanchezRoldan.github.io.git

run 
    $ git pull
so any changes I've made to the project get added to your local copy.

open the project in visual studio code, and make any changes you like!

When you're done, you need to commit the changes with a message. In SOURCE CONTROL tab, you will see a dropdown which says V Changes. Hover over that, and there's a +.
Click it, and write a Message in the Message box saying what you've done.

Once thats done, you should be able to click the tick
