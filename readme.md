## Hi Lucia!

To get started, open your terminal on mac.
in the terminal use

    $ cd DropBox
    
    $ cd LuciaSanchezRoldan.github.io
    

to navigate into the website folder. If you ever delete it, you can 'clone' it again anytime using

    $ git clone https://github.com/LuciaSanchezRoldan/LuciaSanchezRoldan.github.io.git
    
run 

    $ git pull
    
so any changes I've made to the project get added to your local copy.

open the project in visual studio code, and make any changes you like! Feel free to contact me anytime.

When you're done, you need to commit the changes with a message. In the `SOURCE CONTROL` tab, you will see a dropdown which says `V Changes`. Hover over that, and there's a `+`.
Click it, and write a Message in the Message box saying what you've done.

Once thats done, you should be able to click the `tick` &#x2611 &#9745. To make the changes go online, you then need to click `...`
under that dropdown menu, go to `Pull,Push`, and select `Push`. You're done!

If for whatever reason that doesn't work, you can do the same steps in terminal. add all the files with a message by running 

    $ git commit -am 'Message Id like to say'
    
And then you can push to github online by running

    $ git push
    
good luck!
