					<div class="text">
						I, along with a group of other early-career professionals, 
						have decided to commit to some practical steps that we can take to help push the industry forward towards a fairer, 
						more sustainable future.
					</div> <br>
					<div class="status">
						“AS EARLY CAREER THEATRE PROFESSIONALS, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE SCOPE AND IMPACT OF WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE IS LIMITED. 
						HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS EXCUSES US FROM TAKING CONCRETE STEPS WITHIN OUR OWN PRACTICE GOING FORWARD 
						TO HELP ENACT A CULTURE CHANGE IN THE INDUSTRY. WHERE WE FEEL WE MAY LACK THE SWAY TO MAKE DEMANDS OF OUR ENGAGERS, 
						WE CAN CERTAINLY LOBBY, AND COMMIT TO ASKING THE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS TO THOSE ABOVE US.  WE ARE NOT A COLLECTIVE, 
						BUT HAVE SHARED AIMS - AND WE ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO COPY, ADAPT, AND EXPAND UPON THOSE.”
					</div><br><br><br>
					<div class="credit">I PROMISE: </div> <br><br>
					<div class="text">
						<li>
							To ask at every point in the process “How is this accessible?”  
						</li>
						<li>
							To ask how diverse the team is on every prospective job. If it isn’t, to ask “Why not?”
						</li>
						<li>
							To become more transparent about the roles and publish information and paperwork explaining the process.
						</li>
						<li>
							To request a comp (or if unavailable, use our second press night comp) to be made available to a current student - with priority given to students from marginalised groups - to attend the show, and offer our time afterwards to answer any questions about the process. (If you would like to take up this offer, please contact me)
						</li>
						<li>
							To actively seek out and participate in schools outreach work where possible.   
						</li>
						<li>
							To request diversity stats of shows we work on (team and audience), which I can publish on this website
						</li>
						<li>
							To work sustainably
						</li><br>
